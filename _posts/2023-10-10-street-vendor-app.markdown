A street vendor is someone who sells food, goods and merchandise on the street or in an open-air market rather than at a traditional store. 

The vendors will have to contend with days of pouring rain, high winds, and biting cold in which they will be lucky to break even for 
the day. It can be a long day that slowly drags by when no one is coming to a vendor‚Äôs cart, or it can be just the opposite with number of people waiting to buy the items being sold.

When there are no buyers around the vendor faces a hard time, travelling from one lane to another, 
one street to another, and so on, to every nook and corner of the streets, to sell his items until he 
finds buyers in order to make profit for the day which would be his only source of income to make 
a living for himself.

A solution to these problems would be to:

- Allow sellers to view a buyer zone within a 10-kilometer radius of their current location.
- Provide Seller's the access to buyer details and can fulfill requests by delivering products to the buyer's location.
- The app simplifies the process for both sellers and buyers, making their lives more convenient.
-  Make life easier for the seller by avoiding un necessary travel to areas where there are no buyers
- Sellers can optimize their time, effort, and resources by knowing the number of interested buyers.


Happy vacation!! üèñ‚õ±
